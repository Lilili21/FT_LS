• You are allowed to use other functions to carry out
the bonus part as long as their use is justified
during your defence. For example, 
to use tcgetattr is justified in certain case, 
to use printf because you are lazy isn’t. Be smart!

* in src add functions with t_curr: 1. function new t_curr 2. add new t_curr in correct order

@savva
* a bit of ft_ls and main (in fimain);
created a logic and algo of our program %))
