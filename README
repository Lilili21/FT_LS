args:
	-l
	-R !!!!!! think about implications!! on the begin
	-a
	-r
	-t

! if "-l" is not in args –> then no multiple column format
! no errors and leaks
! error mngmnt: why? like no that file or dir, no permitted, permission denied etc


bonuses:
	A, C, L
	mngmnt of columt without "-l" option (man 4 tty)
	-u, -f, -g, -d
	-G (color for type?:)
	optimization   %)

f:
◦ write ◦ opendir ◦ readdir ◦ closedir
◦ stat ◦ lstat ◦ getpwuid 
◦ getgrgid ◦ listxattr ◦ getxattr ◦ time
◦ ctime ◦ readlink ◦ malloc ◦ free
◦ perror ◦ strerror ◦ exit

• You are allowed to use other functions to carry out
the bonus part as long as their use is justified
during your defence. For example, 
to use tcgetattr is justified in certain case, 
to use printf because you are lazy isn’t. Be smart!
