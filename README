! if "-l" is not in args –> then no multiple column format
! no errors and leaks
! error mngmnt: why? like no that file or dir, no permitted, permission denied etc

• You are allowed to use other functions to carry out
the bonus part as long as their use is justified
during your defence. For example, 
to use tcgetattr is justified in certain case, 
to use printf because you are lazy isn’t. Be smart!

logs:
@Liza
* in LSFT_H defined current structure more detailed
* in src add functions with t_curr: 1. function new t_curr 2. add new t_curr in correct order
